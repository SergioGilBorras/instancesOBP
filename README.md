# Standardized Repository for Order Batching Problem Instances

**OBP-Instances** is an open-source collection of all known instances from the academic literature on the *Order Batching Problem (OBP)*. 
All instances are transformed into a unified, machine-readable **JSON** format to ensure consistency and ease of use.

In addition to being a standardized dataset hub, this project provides a basic testing environment and interactive visualization tools to evaluate batching and routing algorithms commonly used in warehouse operations.

## üì¶ Project Overview

This project was developed to consolidate and evaluate OBP datasets published by operations research experts.  
It currently includes **five major datasets**, unified under a single JSON schema, and provides tools to:

- **Parse and Load**: Read standardized JSON files and load them into Java model classes.
- **Visualize**: Display instances and routing paths graphically, including warehouse layouts and picking routes.
- **Evaluate and Optimize**: Use predefined batching constructors, routing heuristics, and objective functions to analyze and compare solutions across datasets.

Additionally, the project includes an **instance generator**, which allows:
- Creating new instances from scratch.
- Modifying existing instances to test custom scenarios or stress-test algorithms.

## üîç Purpose

This tool is ideal for:
- Researchers comparing OBP heuristics or metaheuristics.
- Educators teaching order picking and warehouse optimization.
- Developers testing algorithmic approaches in a controlled environment.
